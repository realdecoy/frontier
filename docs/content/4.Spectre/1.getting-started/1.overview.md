Spectre üîç
======
The Spectre CLI is used to scaffold web & mobile automation projects quickly and easily. The CLI leverages the use of the [WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) framework to enable QA and software engineers to verify the quality of mobile or web applications being developed. The CLI also provides examples for you to quickly run to be able to get going with automated testing!

The CLI also uses the Page Object Pattern which provides a layer of abstraction between the test files and the pages/screens actually being tested. For more information on page objects, you can read [here](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html).

The CLI also provides tooling support to easily create test scripts to verify functionality through the use of [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).

A project created from Spectre also has access to different testing services such as:
- [Appium](https://appium.io/)
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/)
- [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/)

# System Requirements
## Mac
1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
2. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.html)

## Windows
1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
2. [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/windows_manual.jsp)

For web automation, a web browser for web automation (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge or a combination of all of the above).

For mobile automation, you will need the following installed on your machine:

### Windows
- Android SDK and access to emulators: https://developer.android.com/studio/install#windows
- Download Appium https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/download/v1.22.3-4/Appium-Server-GUI-windows-1.22.3-4.exe

### Mac
- Android SDK and access to emulators: https://developer.android.com/studio/install#mac
- Xcode configuration https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/ & https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/
- Download Appium https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/download/v1.22.3-4/Appium-Server-GUI-mac-1.22.3-4.dmg

NB - You can double check your appium installation by installing Appium Doctor using the command below:
```
    npm install -g appium-doctor
```

Then you can verify if your Android or iOS setup is correct (pass either --ios or --android if you want to see if the installation of a specific platform is correct):
```
    appium-doctor
```

Please look at this Appium reference [here](https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/#starting-appium) for more details.

### Recommended tools
We recommend the use of Visual Studio Code as they provide autocompletion for many of the WebDriverIO commands being used by the scaffolded project.

## :heavy_check_mark:  Need for Nuxt.js at RealDecoy?

<br />

```text
Here at RealDecoy the use of Nuxt.js offers the potential to develop full stack applications with just one framework. Nuxt.js offers server-side rendering capabilities that allows for backend development with server side security. With the use of RDVue CLI standards already in place here at RealDecoy, the transition to a project that uses Nuxt.js is much easier as they both have a similar opinionated setup and structure of use here. Developers have noted that the potential for Nuxt.js here at RealDecoy can take us a far way as a pairing of RDVue with Nuxt.js makes good for the development of Single Page Applications.

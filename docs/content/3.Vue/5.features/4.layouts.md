# Layouts

A Layout is a conceptual grouping given to components which serve the purpose of rendering re-usable pieces of UI shared by many pages. An easy example is the header and footer information displayed on many sites: though the body of the page changes often, those elements remain the same.

> A Layout allows us to define the common elements while leaving a slot (router-view) to inject the actual body of the Page.

### Technical

To get a Page to use a Layout, edit its definition in the **router.ts** file and add the following option:

```ts
meta: {
  layout: '<layout-name>',
}
```

For example:

```ts
routes: [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: [...],
    meta: {
      layout: 'two-column',
    },
  },
]
```

Above, the Layout refers to a component within the **src/layouts** directory called **two-column**.

A Layout must contain a router-view to display the Page within the area designated for its content.

Each generated Layout is contained within its own sub-folder within the **src/layouts** directory. The directory contains the following files which each carry out a specific role in developing a Layout:

- **[layout].vue**: This contains the Vue template markup used to implement the structure and layout of a Layout. It is a mix of HTML and special Vue syntaxes which allow declarative databinding and structural manipulation.
- **[layout].ts**: This contains the controller which provides the procedural code-behind logic needed to add integrations to a Layout. Through this file, you may expose data and handle events generated by Layout elements.
- **[layout].scss**: This contains the stylesheet to be applied to the Layout - and that Layout only. The styles within this file are scoped, meaning they cannot be used to target any elements except those defined directly within the [layout].vue template file.

> Scoped CSS may seem weird at first because regular CSS operates with global impunity, however it is a great approach for compartmentalizing styles so they do not jump their intended scope and affect other elements. Global level styles can be added in the [Theme](Theming.md#global-styles) directory.

- **[layout].spec.ts**: This contains the unit-level tests for the Layout. Read the [testing section](Testing.md#unit-tests-with-jest) for more details about writing tests.

### Adding a Layout Using the CLI

To add a layout to your project using the CLI, use the following command:

```bash
frontier vue add layout
```

This command will generate a new Layout with the necessary files and structure, as described above. The Layout will be contained within its own sub-folder in the **src/layouts** directory.

### Adding Components to a Layout

To add components to a Layout, such as a header or footer, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Component:**
   First, create the component (e.g., `AppFooter.vue`) in the **src/components** directory.

2. **Import the Component:**
   Import the component into the Layout's `.vue` file.

3. **Use the Component:**
   Add the component to the Layout's template where you want it to appear.

#### Example of a Barebones Layout

Here is a barebones example of a Layout component:

**src/layouts/default-layout.vue**

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <header>
      <!-- Header content -->
    </header>
    <slot>
      <!-- Page content rendered here -->
    </slot>
    <AppFooter />
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { Component, Vue } from "vue-facing-decorator";
import AppFooter from "@/components/AppFooter.vue";

@Component({
  name: "default-layout",
  components: {
    AppFooter,
  },
})
export default class DefaultLayout extends Vue {}
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Layout styles */
</style>
```

**src/components/AppFooter.vue**

```vue
<template>
  <footer>
    <!-- Footer content -->
    <p>Footer content here</p>
  </footer>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
export default {
  name: "AppFooter",
};
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Footer styles */
footer {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  padding: 1rem;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
```

### Steps to Add a New Layout and Make It Accessible

1. **Create the Layout:**
   Use the CLI to create a new layout.

   ```bash
   frontier vue add layout
   ```

2. **Update the Router:**
   Open the `router.ts` file and add the layout to a route's meta information.
3. **Configure the Layout:**
   Add the necessary layout configuration, including importing and using any common components like headers or footers.

By following these steps, you can create a new layout and make it accessible within your application. For more information on routing and layouts, visit the [Vue Router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/).

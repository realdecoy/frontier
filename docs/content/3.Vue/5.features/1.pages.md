# Pages

A Page is a conceptual grouping for Vue Components used in routing. Pages are **not** to be imported by other Pages, Components, or Layouts.

A special feature of Pages is that they can benefit from Layouts to automatically add a parent container with common pieces of UI/State thatâ€™s shared throughout the application - like Headers and Footers. The [Layouts](layouts) section goes into more detail on this approach.

> A Page needs to be added to the [Router](#routing) before it can be previewed within a web browser.

### Technical

Each generated Page is contained within its own sub-folder within the **src/pages** directory. The directory contains the following files which each carry out a specific role in developing a Page:

* **[page].vue**: This contains the Vue template markup used to implement the structure and layout of a Page. It is a mix of HTML and special Vue syntaxes which allow declarative databinding and structural manipulation.
* **[page].ts**: This contains the TypeScript controller which provides the procedural code-behind logic needed to add integrations to a page. Through this file, you may expose data and handle events generated by Page elements.
* **[page].scss**: This contains the SASS stylesheet to be applied to the page - and that page only. The styles within this file are scoped, meaning they cannot be used to target any elements except those defined directly within the [page].vue template file.

> Scoped CSS may seem weird at first because regular CSS operates with global impunity, however, it is a great approach for compartmentalizing styles so they do not jump their intended scope and affect other elements. Global level styles can be added in the Theme directory.

* **[page].spec.ts**: This contains the unit-level tests for the page. Read the [testing section](Testing.md#unit-tests-with-jest) for more details about writing tests.

### Adding a Page Using the CLI

To add a page to your project using the CLI, use the following command:

```bash
frontier vue add page
```

This command will generate a new Page with the necessary files and structure, as described above. The Page will be contained within its own sub-folder in the **src/pages** directory.

### Making the Page Accessible

To make the new page accessible, you need to update the router configuration. The router is defined in the `router.ts` file, which contains an array of route records. For more information on Vue Router, refer to the [official documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/).

#### Example Router Configuration

Here is an example of how to add a new page to the router:

```typescript
import Vue from 'vue';
import {
  createWebHashHistory,
  createRouter,
  type RouteRecordRaw,
} from 'vue-router';
import SignInView from '@/pages/sign-in';

// Import the new page
import NewPageView from '@/pages/new-page';

export enum RouteNames {
  SignIn = 'sign-in',
  NewPage = 'new-page',
}

export const routes: RouteRecordRaw[] = [
  {
    path: `/${RouteNames.SignIn}`,
    name: RouteNames.SignIn,
    component: SignInView,
    meta: {
      layout: 'default-layout',
      page: {
        title: 'Sign In',
        description: 'This is the sign in page',
      },
    },
  },
  // Add the new page route
  {
    path: `/${RouteNames.NewPage}`,
    name: RouteNames.NewPage,
    component: NewPageView,
    meta: {
      layout: 'default-layout',
      page: {
        title: 'New Page',
        description: 'This is the new page',
      },
    },
  },
];

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHashHistory(import.meta.env.BASE_URL),
  routes,
});

export { router as default, router };
```

### Steps to Add a New Page and Make It Accessible

1. **Create the Page:**
   Use the CLI to create a new page.
   ```bash
   frontier vue add page
   ```

2. **Update the Router:**
   Open the `router.ts` file and import the new page component. Add a new route record for the page in the `routes` array.
   
3. **Configure the Route:**
   Add the necessary route configuration, including path, name, component, and metadata.

By following these steps, you can create a new page and make it accessible within your application. For more information on routing, visit the [Vue Router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/){:target="_blank"}.

# Screens

A Screen is a conceptual grouping for React Native Components used in nagivation. Technically a screen is a component but in order to standardize how we work with react we want you to think of screen as its own thing. Screen are **not** to be imported by other Screen, Components or Layouts.

A Screen needs to be added to the [Navigator](#nagivation) before it can be used within a mobile application.
### Usage

```bash
$ frontier mobile:add:screen <screen-name>

# Example
$ frontier mobile:add:screen login
```
### Technical

Each generated Screen is contained within it's own sub-folder within the **src/screens** directory. The directory contains the following files which each carry out a specific role in developing a Screen:

*   \[screen\].**tsx**: This is similar to a [Component](#component) but this is generally where we make API calls to fetch data to populate the views and import other components. Screen are also used within navigation. 

    
*   \[screen\].**styles.tsx**: All Stylesheet file are the same as the stylesheet used shown in [Component](#component).

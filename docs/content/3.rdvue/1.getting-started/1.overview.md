# Getting Started

`Frontier - Vue` is an opinionated CLI for generating Vue.js projects. We do so by adopting a development style guide which enforces strong typing with TypeScript, standardized Component, Layout and Page models, and a data-layer design promoting unified consumption through Stores and Services.


## Usage
<!-- custom-usage -->

```bash
npx @realdecoy/frontier vue <command>
```
Global installation:

```bash
npm install --global @realdecoy/frontier
frontier vue <command>
```
The help menu can be accessed with the command:

```bash
frontier vue --help

## Validate Installation

We can confirm the successful installation of `Frontier - Vue` in three simple steps:

### Step 1: Create a project

```
frontier vue create-project <project-name>
```

Replace `<project-name>` with the actual name of your project.

Generated folders are named in kebab-case.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

### Step 3: Serve project

```
npm run serve
```

The project will be served at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) by default. This information will also be printed out in your terminal. Visiting the link the app is served on will display a default page which was created on project creation.


## Next Steps

### Generating a Page

```
frontier add page <page-name>
```

Each generated Page gets its own dedicated folder. The folder will be given the name of the page. This folder is located at /src/pages/<page\-name> .

### Generating a Component

```
frontier generate component <component-name>
```

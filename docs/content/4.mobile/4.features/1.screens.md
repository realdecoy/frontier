# Screens

A Screen is a conceptual grouping for React Native Components used in navigation. Technically a screen is a component but in order to standardize how we work with react we want you to think of screen as its own thing. Screens are **not** to be imported by other Screens, Components or Layouts.

A Screen needs to be added to the [Navigator](navigation) before it can be used within a mobile application.
### Usage

```bash
frontier mobile add screen <screen-name>
```

#### Example
```bash
frontier mobile add screen login
```

### Technical

Each generated Screen is contained within it's own sub-folder within the **app** directory. The directory contains the following files which each carry out a specific role in developing a Screen:

*   \[screen\].**tsx**: This is similar to a [Component](component) but this is generally where we make API calls to fetch data to populate the views and import other components. Screens are also used within navigation.


*   \[screen\].**styles.tsx**: All Stylesheet files are the same as the stylesheet shown in [Component](component).

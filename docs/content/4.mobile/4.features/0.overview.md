# Overview

This section will provide a brief introduction to generating features inside a project. Each available feature has a dedicated section in our documentation.

Reading through this section will get you comfortable with the CLI. An in depth look at the command used in this section, along with all available commands, can be found in [CLI Commands](/mobile/cli-commands/usage).


> It is recommended to read through the [CLI Reference](cli-reference.md#add) before continuing with this document.

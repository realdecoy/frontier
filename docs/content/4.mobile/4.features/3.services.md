# Services

Services are focused classes designed to interact with web API endpoints. As a good design pattern a service should:

*   Only interact with a single domain

*   Only provide features from the domain which are relevant to the theme of the service. Eg. A user service should be focused on methods that support such; adding order related data would make for poor encapsulation.

```bash
frontier mobile add service <service-name>
```

#### Example
```bash
frontier mobile add service auth
```

#### Output File
```txt
services/auth.service.tsx
```

### Technical

Each generated service is contained within the sub-folder `services` directory. The directory contains a file for each service that has been created:

*   \[service-name\].**service.tsx**: The file will contain a related grouping of http functions.

*   While each generated service resides in its own file and class, all services extend a predefined BaseService class in order to provide centralized functionality.

*   Each service is able to specify a unique web API endpoint with which to interact - or none at all for services providing local functionality (Eg. wrapper storage mechanism over AsyncStorage).

# Stores / Context

A Context is a mechanism for maintain application state in a way which is globally accessible to all components. We use them as intermediary layers to issue API calls to relevant services, and cache the results for \[re\]use. Though the thought may occur to use a plain JavaScript object to achieve state management, a React Context differs in one distinct ways:

*   Properties are reactive. Changing Context values will automatically propagate to the component-level bindings which use them.
    

An application can have as many Contexts as needed to logically group state concerns. The Frontier CLI creates strongly typed Contexts, enabling full Intellisense and compiler support when writing code against them.

### Usage
    
```bash
frontier mobile add store <store-name>
```

#### Example
```bash
frontier mobile add store auth
```

#### Output File 
```txt
contexts/auth.context.tsx
```

### Technical

Each generated serive is contained within the sub-folder `contexts` directory. The context will provide high order functions that will help you to inject global state within you Class based components. It will also provide you will hooks for you to use in your function based components.

- `ContextName` - This is the provided name for the context when created using the CLI's `add` command above.

- [^1]_HOC (High-Order Component)_ - a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component.

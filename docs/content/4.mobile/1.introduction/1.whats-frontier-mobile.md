# What is Frontier - Mobile?

## About

[Frontier - Mobile](https://github.com/realdecoy/frontier/tree/development/src/commands/mobile) is an opinionated CLI for generating React Native Expo projects. We do so by adopting a development style guide which enforces strong typing with TypeScript, standardized Component, Layout and Screen models,
and a data-layer design promoting unified consumption through React Contexts and Services.
Follow the installation guide to set up the Mobile CLI.

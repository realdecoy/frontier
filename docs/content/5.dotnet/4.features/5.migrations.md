| [remove](migrations#remove) | remove latest migration            |

### Using unsupported Dotnet EF Core Command 

> Learn more about all the available commands from [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)

If you want to use commands that are currently not supported by `frontier dotnet` then you are still in luck. All you need to do is:
#### 1. Attach to the Docker container running the project
You are able to connect to the container using the `docker exec` command.  By default the container name will be the same name used when creating the project. You can also find the container name by using Docker desktop or the docker CLI.
```
docker exec -it <container-name | container-id> sh
```
#### 2. Run your `dotnet` commands
Execute the command you want from the root of your directory. This should be `/app/src/` by default.

##### Example

```
dotnet ef migrations list
```

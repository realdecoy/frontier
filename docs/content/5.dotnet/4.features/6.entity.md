# Entities

### What is it about?
Framework Core entities are used to represent business objects or data models that map to database tables, with properties defining their structure and data types. Relationships between entities can be configured using navigation properties and annotations or fluent API. The DbContext class acts as a bridge between entities and the database, providing APIs for database interaction.

### Examples



**Generate Entity Class** 
```bash
frontier dotnet add entity [name-of-entity]
```
```
namespace NameOfProject.Domain.Entities
{
    public class NameOfEntity
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Property1 { get; set; } = String.Empty;
        public string Property2 { get; set; } = String.Empty;
        public string Property3 { get; set; } = String.Empty;
    }
}
```

Description: This command generates a class entity based of the name used in the command. The file will be located at projectName/src/ProjectNameApi.Domain/NameOfEntity.cs. The file can then be modfied to suit user's desired table.

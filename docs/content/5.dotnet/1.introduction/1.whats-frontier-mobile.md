# What is Frontier - Dotnet?

## About

[Frontier - Dotnet](https://github.com/realdecoy/frontier/tree/development/src/commands/dotnet): This is RealDecoyâ€™s internal development tool/template for Dotnet Web applications which is a template for building web APIs using ASP.NET Core framework in the .NET ecosystem. It aims to provide a starting point and a set of best practices for creating scalable and maintainable APIs.

This is a multi-project solution that utilizes Domain Driven Design (DDD) and CQRS patterns to create a maintainable web API applications which run on Linux or Windows and in Docker environments

### Features
`API Versioning` 
Enables seamless evolution of the API over time by introducing backward-compatible changes while maintaining compatibility with existing clients.

`Fluent Email`
Simplifies email communication within the API by using Fluent Email, a library that offers a fluent and expressive way to send emails.

`Fluent Validation`
Ensures the validity and well-formedness of incoming requests by defining and enforcing validation rules.

`JWT Authentication`
Securely authenticates API requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing stateless and robust authentication capabilities.

`Identity Role-Based Authorization`
Implements role-based access control using ASP.NET Core Identity, granting fine-grained authorization to API endpoints based on user roles.

`In Memory Caching`
Boosts API performance and reduces load on data sources by caching frequently accessed data or responses in memory.

`IP Rate Limiting`
Safeguards the API against abusive or excessive requests from individual IP addresses by implementing IP rate limiting.

`CQRS with Mediator`
Adopts the CQRS pattern using Mediator to separate read and write operations, enhancing scalability and simplifying complex business logic.

`Serilog`
Integrates Serilog, a powerful logging framework, to effectively capture and manage application logs, facilitating troubleshooting and monitoring.

`Swagger using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Architecture Principles`
Generates interactive API documentation using Swagger while adhering to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and architectural best practices for clarity and structure.

## About 

Frontier offers a set of standard libraries and typing kits that can be use across engineering projects to allow for more consistency software development. With frontier, a set of plugins are available for use by developers which can be used to easily generate base project files contributing to a faster development process. 

## Usage
 
<!-- custom-usage -->
When using the frontier cli tool it is prefered that when runing commands `yarn` is used over `npm`. When `npm` is used some  frontier's mono repositoy features may not work as they should therefore `yarn` is needed. Using `yarn` also allows for parallel installation of the frontier tool to take place.

#### [Bootstraping](https://lerna.js.org/docs/core-concepts/bootstrapping)
Bootstraping allows for the linking of different frontier packages so they can import and utilize each other without having to be published.
To bootstrap all frontier packages and their dependencies run the command:
```
npm run bootstrap 
```
or
```
yarn run bootstrap 
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

#### [Type Checking](https://lerna.js.org/docs/core-concepts/bootstrapping)
Type checking, see the validation of the type of very variable in the code base.
To type check all frontier packages and their dependencies run the command:
```
npm run typecheck
```
or
```
yarn run typecheck
```

## Development Instructions 

### Building

#### Build
The build command rebuilds all packages and notify the user of the success of the packages being rebuilt.
To build the packages of frontier, run the command:

```bash
yarn run build
```
or 
```bash
npm run build
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


#### Rebuild
Rebuilding the frontier packages automatically reconstructs the packages forgetting about any previous compliation of them.
To rebuild the frontier packages, run the command:

```bash
yarn run rebuild
```
or 
```bash
npm run rebuild
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;


### Testing
Testing any piece of software created is critical for developers. Frontier uses the jest configuration for testing the packages in its monorepository. 
[`Testing Monorepo with Jest`](https://orlandobayo.com/blog/monorepo-testing-using-jest/)

&nbsp; 

##### Run Unit Test Suites From Root
To test all frontier packages from the root level run the command:

```
npm run test
```
or
```
yarn run test
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; 

##### Run Unit Test Suites From Package Level
To test all frontier packages from the package level run the command:

```
npm run test:packages
```
or
```
yarn run test:packages
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; 

##### Run Unit Test Suites From Package Level with Coverage Report
Test converage is a measure of the amount of testing preformed by a test suite. 
To get a test coverage report of Frontier packages run the command:

```
npm run test:packages:ci
```
or
```
yarn run test:packages:ci
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  

### Nuking
Nuking strips the source code of all distribuatble code previously built. 

#### Nuke
To nuke the packages of frontier, run the command:

```bash
yarn run nuke
```
or 
```bash
npm run nuke
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; 


#### Nuke:artifacts
To nuke artifacts of the frontier packages, run the command:

```bash
yarn run nuke:artifacts
```
or 
```bash
npm run nuke:artifacts
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

## Creating a frontier based project
#### [Adam](https://github.com/realdecoy/frontier/tree/main/templates/adam)
To support the creation of new frointer-based projects a template, [Adam](https://github.com/realdecoy/frontier/tree/main/templates/adam), has been provided to allow for easier development. This template provides the basic structure needed to develop a simple frontier-based project.
